## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is @ritzesrepo
I am an Information Assurance and Cyber Defense major at Northern Michigan University School of Business.

I hardly know how to actually code, BEWARE!

Currently working towards:
- Linux mastery
- More Python
- More automotive hacking
- Hacking!
- Want to learn some Lua, for neovim purposes
- Fix mintvim (IMPOSIBLE)
- Clean up dot files
- Write install scripts

I get all this work done on a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 7 system board that I managed to get working inside of an X1 Yoga Gen 5 chassis.
If not; it's probably one of my like 20 other Thinkpads I got lying around here.

Current config:
Arch Linux ...btw 
Wayland 
Hyprland 
Kitty 
Zsh w/ a few plugins
